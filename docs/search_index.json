Compared to a single tree model, the sum-of-trees can more easily incorporate additive effects. Various methods which combine a set of tree models, so-called ensemble methods, have attracted much attention. These include boosting, bagging, and random forests, each of which uses different techniques to fit a linear combination of trees. Yet another approach that results in a linear combination of trees is Bayesian model averaging applied to the posterior arising from a Bayesian single-tree model. In this project, we study a Bayesian approach called BART (Bayesian Additive Regression Trees) which uses a sum of trees to model or approximate \\(f(x) = E(Y | x)\\). The essential idea is to elaborate the sum-of-trees model by imposing a prior that regularizes the fit by keeping the individual tree effects small. In effect, the \\(g_j\\)’s become a dimensionally adaptive random basis of “weak learners.” By weakening the \\(g_j\\) effects, BART ends up with a sum of trees, each of which explains a small and different portion of f.
